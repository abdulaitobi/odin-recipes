    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>
        This slow cooker pot roast only takes six ingredients to make thanks to a packet of onion soup mix.  It gives the roast a ton of flavor without a ton of
        work, and no one will even know it’s there.  The best part?  You just dump everything into the slow cooker, walk away for a few hours, and dinner 
        practically cooks itself.  Serve it over egg noodles or rice and dinner is good to go.
